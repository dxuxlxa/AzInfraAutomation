# This repo contains a set of scripts that i developed and used to set up different kinds of infrastructure on Azure, like VPNs and email servers. The scripts are designed to be run from a shell and are intended for use with the Azure CLI. The scripts are not intended to be used in production environments, but rather as a starting point for setting up your own infrastructure.
## The AZOVPN up all the infrastructure required to get an OpenVPN server running, replace example.env with your azure subscription info and chosen names. For the fastest and easist OpenVPN set up, I highly recommend https://github.com/dockovpn/dockovpn. The AzureWG is very similar, but uses Wireguard instead of OpenVPN. The powershell directory contains the script needed to get a mail server (mailcow) up and running. It also loads a cloud init file to automate the provisioning of packages on the newly created VM.
